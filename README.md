# World_Weather_Analysis
WeatherPy Analysis with Python APIs

## Overview of Project

To create a list of locations that satisfy the preference of the people inputting data and visualizing the list on a map, and then using that list to choose locations to create a travel route.

### Purpose

To create a list of random locations, then using that list to isolate ideal Vacation cities based on the input of beta testers. With the preferred locations list, a map is made using Google APIs which included nearby hotels and weather data. Afterwards, a few cites are chosen from the list of ideal Vacation cities and used to create a travel itinerary with a map of routes using Google Maps APIs.

I have included images here for easy reference:
